# JobPortal
I developed a secure backend system using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, featuring user registration, authentication with bcrypt and JWT, and job postings. I implemented RESTful APIs for managing job listings, integrated middleware for enhanced functionality, and ensured robust error handling and validation.

I utilized modern development tools and practices, including environment variable management with dotenv, automatic server restarts with nodemon, CORS for cross-origin requests, cookie-parser for cookie management, and express-fileupload for handling file uploads. This approach allowed me to create a scalable and maintainable application that meets security and performance standards.
